# Facebook-Ads-Project
A deep dive into Facebook's 2020-2021 advertisements obtained from Meta's Marketing API related to the COVID-19 vaccine and the presidential election.

## Overview

In this project, we performed very detailed EDA, employed NLP practices such as sentiment analysis to understand how political advertisers think, generated numerous, informative visualizations and developed ML models to help future advertisers predict the number of impressions their advertisement will receive.

I worked with a group of 4 students as part of the DS3 team at UCSD.
