# Facebook-Ads-Project
A deep dive into Facebook's 2020-2021 advertisements obtained from Facebook's Marketing API related to the COVID-19 vaccine and the presidential election.

## Overview

In this project, we performed very detailed EDA, employed NLP practices such as sentiment analysis to understand how political advertisers think, generated numerous, informative viualizations and developed ML models to help future advertisers predict the amount of impressions their advertisement will recieve.

What you see in this repository is the work that I was responsible for. I worked with a group of 4 students as part of the DS3 team at UCSD.
